What do you get when you turn to the man in slacks
Who’s in batter getting fatter, they’re just turning their backs
You gotta pay for that money boy, You gotta pay for that money boy
You gotta pay for that money boy, You gotta pay for that money boy
Jacked, chipped, tighten up the grip you hold on the handle of a homemade whip
Flushed, fried, hogtied the tail by female waiting so perfectly shy
What do you get when you burn through your plastic stacks
Mouth full of honey, ain’t it funny now you scratching for cash
You gotta pay for that money boy, You gotta pay for that money boy
You gotta pay for that money boy, You gotta pay for that money boy
